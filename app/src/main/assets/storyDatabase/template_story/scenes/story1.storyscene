talk narrator "I am an ordinary guy minding their own business as a highschooler. I go up a grade, and my class composition gets scrambled. Everyone is replaced with strangers I've only seen in passing glances."
talk narrator "The class chatters as everyone gets to know each other. A girl who sits next to me does the same; this time to me."

talk lommie "Hi! I've never seen you before!"
talk lommie "I'm Lommie!!"

talk narrator "She extends an arm out decorated with green bracelets, matching her vibrant long green hair which looks well brushed. Her grin is tall; her teeth sharp. "
talk narrator "I introduced myself to her."

talk you "Me?? um yeah Hello, i'm y/n."
talk lommie "I'm partial to a little dirty beat making."
talk lommie "Look! I'm making one right now on my phone!!"
talk lommie "The UI sucks, which makes sense given DAWs were primarily made on computers back in the day."
talk lommie "...But the music doesn't!!"
talk lommie "Wanna give a listen?"
talk you "...sure."

talk narrator "I listen to the dirty beat with the large white headphones she had on her neck."

talk you "...This sucks."
talk lommie "Yeah!!"
talk you "..."
talk you "Why is there a moaning sound...?"
talk lommie "Yeah!!"

talk narrator "The teacher comes in and class starts."
talk narrator "Days passed. My usual school day routine remains the same even with the different class composition. There is only one change though: her."

talk lommie "So, like, I punched him in the face when he insulted my cool bracelets."
talk you "Did you really have to punch him?"
talk lommie "Action is a representation of who we are. And Iâ€¦ am a noble cool girl."
talk lommie "I am also in trouble for putting that guy in the hospital."

talk narrator "She's...odd."
talk narrator "But she's oddly fun to talk to. Any topic."

talk you "Dogs or cats?"
talk lommie "...I like s-quir-elles."
talk you "That's how you say squirrels?"
talk lommie "I'm not bothered to say it correctly!!"

talk narrator "She's great, honestly."
talk narrator "Though, there is something I can't shake off from her."
talk narrator "That stare."
talk narrator "I only caught it once or twice in my time with her. Whenever I wasn't looking...she would just...look at me. Unending gaze. Piercing eyes."
talk narrator "Maybe that's just one of hr oddities. Maybe."

label CHAPTER_2
talk narrator "Another school day comes by. I sit semi-sleepy on my desk."
talk narrator "Lommie said something about schools starting way to early to accomodate for the neurological development of teenagers." 
talk narrator "She's right but I'm too sleepy to think straight."

talk lommie "Boo!"

talk narrator "Lommie pierces my side and I jump up."
talk narrator "She giggles. Her smile as tall as ever. We spitball as usual before class starts." 
talk narrator "Just before the teacher came in, she gets quieter than usual."

talk lommie "So, uhm. I was thinking..."
talk lommie "Do you, wanna come over to my place later?"
talk you "Why?"
talk lommie "I..."

talk narrator "She spheres her fingers with eachother; unusually looking away from me."

talk lommie "I...wanted to show you something."
talk narrator "I chuckle."
talk you "...another dirty beat?"

talk narrator "She chuckles too, albeit in a higher pitch than usual."

talk you "Is roasted corn the only flavour of these chips?"

talk narrator "I see Lommie's fingers twitch at the sides of the bowl."

talk lommie "I-It's the best one!"

talk narrator "I can't say much. Neither can she."

talk you "...Lommie."
talk you "...Are you hiding something?"

talk lommie "I..."
talk lommie "I don't know how to say it..."
talk lommie "But..."
